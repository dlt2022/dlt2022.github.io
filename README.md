The last years have witnessed an impressive and increasing interest around Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). A huge number of application fields, including finance, academics, IoT, industries, just to mention some of the most popular ones, are experiencing the advantages of reliable and unalterable information storage and exchange without any trusted third party. Despite this, several issues are still open and deserve discussion in the scientific and professional community. Among them, a prominent role is played by privacy and security. While some security properties (e.g., countering double spending in cryptocurrencies) have been extensively studied, other aspects need to be deepened, ranging from software security to scalability, dependability, up to new challenges, like post-quantum blockchains. Similarly for privacy, where the DLT paradigm also has to coexist with current regulations.
